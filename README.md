MobiWriter _Plus!_
==========

Minimal writer for the mobipocket format; images ARE supported (but must be cross-referenced manually). Nothing else is supported.
Forked from [MobiWriter](https://github.com/cafaxo/MobiWriter). An enhancement 7 years later... great code is timeless; thank you 
Lukas Mayrhofer!
#### Usage 

1. Change the source code within `main.cpp` to include all the files you want to end up in the MOBI file.
2. `g++ main.cpp`
3. `chmod +x a.out`
4. `./a.out`
